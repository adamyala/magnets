You name me
Who am I
That I should company with something so divine?
Mercy waits, Overjoyed
Prospect of finding, freeing
Freeing me

Love is the thing this time I'm sure
And I couldn't need you more now
The way that you saw things were so pure
Overjoyed

You name me
Entertain
Thoughts of peace can overcome anything
Mirror spins
Wicked tales
Here lies reflections of
Deceptions of

Love is the thing this time I'm sure
And I couldn't need you more now
The way that you saw things were so pure
Overjoyed

Missing the me from you you gave to me
I don't like the one I have created today
Crossing nameless from the one I've earned
To be the one, the one you gave to me

You name me
Name Me
Finding, freeing me

Love is the thing this time I'm sure
And I couldn't need you more now
The way that you saw things were so pure
Overjoyed

Love is the thing this time I'm sure
And I couldn't need you more now
The way that you saw things were so pure
Overjoyed

Overjoyed, Overjoyed
