It's not my problem anymore
You see it never really was
So you can stop 'caring' as you call it
and I'll be fine right here

You see that I can play a pretty convincing role
So I don't need you, I don't think I need you

But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing

You can't hear what I'm not saying
And I can hold out long enough
Treading water I keep from sinking
I'm not one for reaching

You see that I can play a pretty convincing role
So I don't need you, I don't think I need you

But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing

Deny myself, deny my heart
Deny your hand, deny your help
and you offer me eternity
but why should I buy that?

You see that I can play a pretty convincing role
So I don't need you, I don't think I need you

But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing

But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing
