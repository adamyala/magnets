Cynical, just your way
You play the doubting Thomas
Feel the scars and wipe the stains

So you fight, and retreat
And talk yourself out of believing
in any peace that you can't see

Blind words you call
Blind words will fall

You're logical, you can't find
any reason to believe in love
you are blind

Crucify, and deny, pass the blame and burn the mission
Till dust remains and wash your hands

Blind words you call
Blind words will fall
